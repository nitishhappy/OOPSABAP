" Given an array of positive and negative numbers, the task is to find if there is a subarray (of size at least one) with 0 sum.

* Examples: 

* Input: {4, 2, -3, 1, 6}
* Output: true 
* Explanation:
* There is a subarray with zero sum from index 1 to 3.

* Input: {4, 2, 0, 1, 6}
* Output: true
* Explanation: The third element is zero. A single element is also a sub-array.

* Input: {-3, 2, 3, 1, 6}
* Output: false0

* To find a subarray with a sum of 0 in an array, we can use a hash map to keep track of the cumulative sum at each index. If the cumulative sum at two different indices is the same, it means the subarray between these indices has a sum of 0.

* Explanation:
* Cumulative Sum: As we traverse the array, we keep a running total of the elements seen so far. This running total is called the cumulative sum.

* Hash Map: We use a hash map to store the cumulative sum and its corresponding index. If the cumulative sum at a particular index is seen before, it means the elements between the previous index and the current index sum to 0.

* Subarray Detection: If the cumulative sum is zero at any point, it means there is a subarray from the start of the array to the current index that sums to 0. Additionally, if any cumulative sum repeats, the elements between the first occurrence of this sum and the current index sum to 0.

* Explanation of the Code:
* Initialization:

* We define a table lt_array to store the input array.
* We define a table lt_hashmap to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding indices.
* We initialize lv_sum to store the cumulative sum.
* Starting the Hash Map:

* We initialize the hash map with a cumulative sum of 0 at index -1 to handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning.
* Traversing the Array:

* We loop through each element of the array.
* For each element, we update the cumulative sum.
* We check if this cumulative sum has been seen before using the hash map.
* If the cumulative sum has been seen, we determine the start and end indices of the subarray with sum 0.
* If the cumulative sum is new, we add it to the hash map with the current index.
* Output:

* If a subarray with sum 0 is found, we output the start and end indices.
* If no such subarray is found, we output that no subarray with sum 0 was found.
